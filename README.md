# Tic Tac Toe

This simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Python is to let you
get the hang of using Git and GitHub.

We're going to implement the functions we first stubbed in
the GitBook chapter on [Functional Abstractions](https://estl.gitbooks.io/moe-computing-course/content/chapters/2-abstraction.html)

## Instructions
